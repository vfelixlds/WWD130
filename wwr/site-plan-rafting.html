    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>[Our audience consists of young, hardworking riders aged 18 to 30 who rely on their motorcycles for daily transportation, primarily 
        to commute to work. They typically use low-displacement motorcycles, favor affordable and competitive pricing when purchasing parts, 
        and prioritize cost-effective maintenance to keep their bikes running smoothly. Convenience is essential, so they prefer mobile-friendly 
        solutions, allowing them to quickly shop for motorcycle parts, request repairs, and access emergency assistance. Safety is also a major concern, 
        leading them to seek protective gear and reliable support services. They value quality but need budget-conscious options, making free budget estimates
        without commitment a great advantage. This audience is practical, efficiency-driven, and focused on affordability, ensuring their motorcycles remain 
        dependable while keeping costs under control.
